# smalllatticelll
finding outliers in hermite factor among small lattices

set of tools for generating small random lattices and finding their hermite factors under LLL

used to look for outliers in terms of hermite factor to do further investigation on their structure

options for random lattice generation method:
by hnf, from https://doi.org/10.3390/e23111509

by solving system of congruences, from https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/237814.237838

another hnf-ish method from https://doi.org/10.1007/11792086_18
